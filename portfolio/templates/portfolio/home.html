                    Hi, my name is Filip and I'm willing to become a professional developer. I discovered my passion 
                    for coding about <b>six years</b> ago when I picked C++ as my first programming language. Although I had 
                    no idea what I was doing back then, I was stunned by the amount of possibilities that coding could
                    give. I was finding learning new programming structures and technics very fascinating, since I've 
                    always loved to experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been <b>studying IT</b> in The State University of Applied Sciences in ElblÄ…g. During that time I've learnt
                    a lot and I have been always trying to use that knowledge in my hobby projects. After I gained more experience
                    I decided that creating <b>web applications</b> is what I was willing to do professionally. Because of the fact 
                    I felt confident in writing <b>python</b> code, I decided to pick <b>django</b> as my main backend framework. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking forward to gaining my first commercial experience in a real-life job as a <b>backend/fullstack</b> developer.
                    I really hope you will like this website, as well as some of my projects attached below. 
                </p>
